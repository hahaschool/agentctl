# Project Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-03-13 (scoped control-plane security hardening PR #123; §12.5 cleanup on PR completion PR #125; native-import CI stabilization PR #126)

## Current State

AgentCTL is a multi-machine AI agent orchestration platform with:

- **Web App**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React Query + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Control Plane**: Fastify + PostgreSQL + BullMQ + Drizzle ORM
- **Agent Worker**: Claude Agent SDK + node-pty + PM2
- **Mobile**: React Native (Expo) — early stage, but already ships unified session browsing/filtering, managed runtime session controls, handoff history, and agent detail streaming
- **CI/CD**: 9 GitHub Actions workflows (build, test, deploy, security, fleet)
- **Security**: OWASP Agentic Top 10 compliance, CodeQL + Semgrep + Trivy + ZAP

**7,255+ unit tests** across 111 files + **143 Playwright e2e tests**. All packages build and lint cleanly (TypeScript 0 errors, Biome 0 errors).

---

## 1. Infrastructure

> CI/CD pipeline, deployment, fleet management, database migrations.

<details>
<summary>✅ All complete — 9 workflows, full deploy chain, fleet rollout</summary>

### 1.1 CI Hardening

- [x] `dorny/paths-filter` for monorepo-aware conditional builds
- [x] pnpm store caching + TypeScript build cache
- [x] Security scanning: `pnpm audit`, `gitleaks`, Biome security lint

### 1.2 Docker Build & Registry

- [x] Multi-stage Docker build (`node:22-alpine`, non-root uid 1001)
- [x] Image tagging: `sha-<commit>`, `main-latest`/`dev-latest`, semver `v*.*.*`
- [x] Trivy + Grype container scanning, SBOM generation

### 1.3 Deployment Pipeline

- [x] Dev auto-deploy via Tailscale SSH on push to `dev`
- [x] Production deploy with GitHub Environment approval gate + blue-green
- [x] Rollback workflow (`workflow_dispatch` with tag selector)
- [x] Fleet deploy: canary → verify → matrix deploy remaining machines

### 1.4 Database Migration Safety

- [x] PR validation: throwaway PostgreSQL + `drizzle-kit generate`
- [x] Deploy-time: migration in transaction, `pg_dump` backup, destructive ops need approval

### 1.5 Observability & Notifications

- [x] Slack/Discord webhooks on deploy success/failure
- [x] Vector → ClickHouse structured logging pipeline
- [x] Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint

**Workflows**: `ci.yml`, `build-images.yml`, `deploy-dev.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`, `rollback.yml`, `deploy-fleet.yml`, `migration-check.yml`, `security-audit.yml`

</details>

## 2. Runtime Engine

> Agent lifecycle, scheduling, session control, execution safety.

<details>
<summary>✅ Scheduling, loop controller, session control — all delivered</summary>

### 2.1 Scheduled Sessions

- [x] `ScheduleConfig` type with `sessionMode: 'fresh' | 'resume'`
- [x] Prompt template variables: `{{date}}`, `{{iteration}}`, `{{lastResult}}`
- [x] DB: `schedule_config` JSONB column, cron API endpoints

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-02-scheduled-sessions-and-loop-design.md](plans/2026-03-02-scheduled-sessions-and-loop-design.md) (archived)

### 2.2 Continuous Loop (Ralph Loop)

- [x] `LoopController` with 3 modes: `result-feedback`, `fixed-prompt`, `callback`
- [x] Limits: `maxIterations`, `costLimitUsd`, `maxDurationMs`
- [x] Safety: dead-loop detection, cost alerts at 80%, auto-pause on checkpoint failure
- [x] SSE events: `loop_iteration`, `loop_checkpoint`, `loop_complete`

### 2.3 Session Control Architecture (3-Layer)

- [x] **Layer 1**: Claude Code CLI `-p` mode (primary — subprocess with structured I/O)
- [x] **Layer 2**: Agent SDK wrapper (hooks, tool gating, output streaming)
- [x] **Layer 3**: tmux fallback (attach to existing sessions)

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-03-session-takeover-design.md](plans/2026-03-03-session-takeover-design.md) (archived)

</details>

### 2.4 Remote Control Integration (Relay Decision + Manual Takeover) — P2

> Claude Code Remote Control is an outbound relay to `claude.ai/code`.
> Current Anthropic docs no longer frame it as Max-only, but AgentCTL's managed
> runtime still fits `claude -p` better because `stream-json`, worker-side
> events, hooks, loops, and scheduled sessions already depend on local
> structured control.
> See [2026-03-10-remote-control-relay-decision.md](plans/2026-03-10-remote-control-relay-decision.md)
> for the spike decision memo.
>
> Status note: The relay decision is complete, and a narrow manual takeover flow
> is already on `main` for Claude managed sessions via shared contracts,
> worker/control-plane lifecycle routes, `RcSessionManager`, and runtime-session
> web controls. The remaining roadmap item here is re-evaluating the relay only
> if Anthropic later exposes richer programmatic session APIs.

- [x] Spike: evaluate Remote Control relay vs current CLI `-p`
- [x] Decision: keep `claude -p` as the primary managed-session path for now
- [x] Narrow manual takeover flow for Claude managed sessions (`RcSessionManager`, worker/control-plane routes, runtime-session web controls)
- [ ] Re-evaluate only if Anthropic exposes programmatic relay events/session APIs

> Manual takeover design: [plans/2026-03-11-manual-remote-takeover-design.md](plans/2026-03-11-manual-remote-takeover-design.md)
> Impl plan: [plans/2026-03-11-manual-remote-takeover-impl-plan.md](plans/2026-03-11-manual-remote-takeover-impl-plan.md)

### 2.5 Structured Execution Summary — P1 ✅

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md](plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md) §11.1
>
> Status note: Fully delivered on `main` via PRs #32 (generation + types) and
> #39 (live SSE streaming + web/mobile rendering). The worker generates
> summaries on completion, streams them via `execution_summary` SSE events,
> and web/mobile render summary cards in session detail views.

Auto-generate structured summary at task completion via session resume.

- [x] Define `ExecutionSummary` type (status, workCompleted, executiveSummary, filesChanged, followUps, cost)
- [x] Implement summary generation in `AgentInstance.stop()`; post-hoc fallback already exists in the run summary route
- [x] DB migration: `agent_runs.result_summary` JSONB
- [x] SSE event: `execution_summary`
- [x] API: `GET /api/runs/:id/summary`
- [x] Summary card in web/mobile session view

### 2.6 Workdir Safety Tiers — P1 ✅

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md](plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md) §11.2

Pre-execution safety: safe (git clean) → guarded (dirty) → risky (non-git) → unsafe (parallel).

- [x] `checkWorkdirSafety()` in `agent-worker/src/runtime/workdir-safety.ts`
- [x] Gate in `AgentInstance.start()` before `attemptSdkRun()`
- [x] SSE events: `safety_warning`, `safety_approval_needed`, `safety_blocked`
- [x] Sandbox mode: copy-to-temp → execute → copy-back
- [x] API: `POST /api/agents/:id/safety-decision` (approve/reject/sandbox)

### 2.7 Dispatch Signature Verification — P1 ✅

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md](plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md) §11.3
>
> Status note: Implemented on `main` via signed control-plane dispatches, worker-side
> verification, and verification-key bootstrap on register/heartbeat. Remaining
> work here is roadmap hygiene rather than missing runtime wiring.

Ed25519 signing of dispatch payloads for defense-in-depth.

- [x] Control plane: sign payloads with TweetNaCl Ed25519
- [x] Workers: verify signature before execution, reject invalid
- [x] Public key distributed during machine registration
- [x] Audit: log verification failures

### 2.8 Mid-Execution Steering — P2 ✅

> Status note: Delivered on `main` via PR #45. `AgentInstance.steer()` using SDK
> `streamInput()`, worker + CP routes, `steer_injected` SSE event, and web
> `SteerInput` component in session detail view. Full test coverage across
> all packages.

Inject guidance into running sessions via SDK `streamInput()`.

- [x] `steer(message)` on `AgentInstance`
- [x] Worker API: `POST /api/agents/:agentId/steer`
- [x] Control plane proxy → forward to worker
- [x] SSE events: `steer_injected`
- [x] Chat-like input in live session view (`SteerInput` component)

### 2.9 Execution Environment Registry — P3

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-11-execution-environment-registry-design.md](plans/2026-03-11-execution-environment-registry-design.md)
> Impl plan: [plans/2026-03-11-execution-environment-registry-impl-plan.md](plans/2026-03-11-execution-environment-registry-impl-plan.md)
>
> Status note: Phase 1 is already on `main`. Shared execution-environment
> contracts, `ExecutionEnvironment`/`DirectEnvironment`, worker capability
> reporting, and control-plane environment selection are landed. The remaining
> gap here is `DockerEnvironment`, which the plan intentionally stages after
> `AgentOutputStream` stabilizes.

Orthogonal WHERE (local/Docker/SSH) vs WHAT (Claude/Codex) abstraction.

- [x] `ExecutionEnvironment` interface: detect, prepare, cleanup
- [x] `DirectEnvironment` (subprocess)
- [x] `DockerEnvironment` (gVisor) *(PR #69 — gVisor runtime, cap-drop, read-only FS, network=none)*
- [x] Auto-detect at startup, report in heartbeat
- [x] Dispatch routing considers environment requirements

## 3. Multi-Runtime & Handoff

> Codex integration, cross-agent switching, unified output streaming.

<details>
<summary>✅ Codex core integration + handoff protocol — delivered</summary>

### 3.1 Codex CLI Core Integration

- [x] `ManagedRuntime = 'claude-code' | 'codex'` in shared contracts
- [x] `CodexRuntimeAdapter` + `CodexSessionManager` (create, resume, fork)
- [x] Runtime-aware routes: `GET|POST /api/runtime-sessions`, resume, fork, handoff
- [x] Machine registry: Codex sessions use same resolution path as Claude

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-09-codex-claude-runtime-unification-design.md](plans/2026-03-09-codex-claude-runtime-unification-design.md)

### 3.2 Session Handoff Protocol

> Status note: The native-import path remains experimental on `main`, but
> PR #126 already stabilized the worker integration test/log coverage around
> native-import preflight plus snapshot fallback. No broader native-import
> feature scope should be inferred from that merge.

- [x] `SessionHandoff` protocol: portable snapshot (worktree, branch, SHA, diff, conversation, MCP/skills)
- [x] `HandoffController`: export snapshot → hydrate target runtime → preserve worktree
- [x] Handoff reasons: `model-affinity`, `cost-optimization`, `rate-limit-failover`, `manual`
- [x] Experimental native import scaffolding with automatic snapshot fallback
- [x] Audit: every handoff + native import attempt logged

</details>

### 3.3 AgentOutputStream — Unified Output Streaming — P2 ✅

> Status note: Delivered on `main` via PR #29. Shared output contract,
> EventEmitter-backed stream, OutputBuffer, and runtime adapter integration
> are all landed.

Shared output contract between runtime adapters. Foundation for multi-runtime.

- [x] Define `AgentOutputStream` interface (text, thinking, toolUse, toolResult, fileChange, costUpdate, error)
- [x] Refactor `sdk-runner.ts` to emit through `AgentOutputStream`
- [x] `AgentInstance` stream impl backed by EventEmitter + OutputBuffer
- [x] Both `ClaudeRuntimeAdapter` and `CodexRuntimeAdapter` use same interface

### 3.4 Codex Operational Parity — P2

> Status note: Partially delivered on `main`. The worker already renders managed
> Codex config, including sandbox, approval, provider, and shell-environment
> policy, detects Codex auth, runs under the shared PM2 worker process, and
> includes sandbox/network helper primitives. LiteLLM routing/failover is already
> landed; the remaining gap is runtime-level enforcement/evidence for
> bubblewrap/Seatbelt or container-backed restrictions on the Codex path.

- [x] LiteLLM config: Codex model routing with OpenAI Direct → Azure OpenAI failover
- [x] PM2 ecosystem config for Codex-capable worker processes
- [x] Azure OpenAI credential detection for Codex authentication
- [x] Config renderer: `modelProvider`, `reasoningEffort`, and shell environment policy in Codex TOML
- [x] Sandbox constraints end-to-end: post-spawn verification (bubblewrap/Seatbelt/Codex), network enforcement, SSE `sandbox_verified` event *(PR #70)*

### 3.5 Automatic Handoff Triggers — P2

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-11-automatic-handoff-triggers-design.md](plans/2026-03-11-automatic-handoff-triggers-design.md)
> Impl plan: [plans/2026-03-11-automatic-handoff-triggers-impl-plan.md](plans/2026-03-11-automatic-handoff-triggers-impl-plan.md)
>
> Status note: Phase 1 is already on `main`. Shared auto-handoff contracts,
> decision persistence, policy evaluation, run handoff history, and
> dispatch-time task-affinity dry-run suggestions are landed. Live
> rate-limit/cost-threshold execution remains deferred until
> `AgentOutputStream` is stable.

- [x] Rate limit hit → failover to other agent type *(PR #66 — LiveHandoffOrchestrator + AgentInstance integration)*
- [x] Cost threshold → switch to cheaper model/provider *(PR #66 — CostThresholdTrigger wired into AgentInstance)*
- [x] Task-type affinity rules (dispatch-time dry-run suggestions + decision logging)
- [x] Handoff history API: `GET /api/runs/:id/handoff-history`

### 3.6 Unified Memory Layer — P1

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-10-unified-memory-layer-design.md](plans/2026-03-10-unified-memory-layer-design.md)
> Impl plan: [plans/2026-03-10-unified-memory-layer-impl-plan.md](plans/2026-03-10-unified-memory-layer-impl-plan.md)
>
> Status note: Substantially delivered on `main` via PRs #30 (claude-mem
> migration tooling), #31 (memory cutover: dual-backend `MemoryInjector`,
> memory API routes, memory MCP server), and #43 (3-tier context budget:
> pinned + on-demand + triggered injection with token/fact limits).
> Remaining work is knowledge-engineering follow-through.

- [x] SQL migration `0010`: pgvector extension, `memory_facts` (HNSW index), `memory_edges`, `memory_scopes`
- [x] Drizzle schema + embedding client (text-embedding-3-small via LiteLLM)
- [x] `MemoryStore`: CRUD with scope isolation, dedup, Ebbinghaus decay
- [x] `MemorySearch`: hybrid search (vector + BM25 + graph CTE + RRF fusion)
- [x] `MemoryInjector` refactor: dual-backend (Mem0 / PG) via `MEMORY_BACKEND` env var
- [x] Memory API routes: search, add, list, delete (with scope filtering)
- [x] Context budget: maxTokens 2400, maxFacts 20, 3-tier injection (pinned + on-demand + triggered)
- [x] Memory MCP server for runtime-side access
- [x] Migration path: dual-write → import → cutover
- [x] Claude-mem data migration: audit → import script (PG target) → API dual-read → UI migration → MCP transition → cleanup

- [x] Meta-cognition: extraction quality rules embedded in extraction LLM prompt *(direct commit)*
- [x] `memory_feedback` MCP tool: `used` / `irrelevant` / `outdated` signals *(PR #58)*
- [x] Knowledge synthesis: weekly cron Phase 1 (lint) + Phase 2 (LLM-proposed principles, human review) *(direct commit)*
- [x] Contradiction detection: `contradicts` edges trigger human review flags *(direct commit)*

## 7. Developer Knowledge Engineering

> Improvements to how agents learn and accumulate knowledge during AgentCTL development itself. Inspired by [stonepage's Agent 知识工程实践](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1898602837).

### 7.1 Layered Knowledge Loading — P2

Restructure `.claude/rules/` to avoid always-loading all rules. Most rules should be on-demand with trigger-based loading.

- [x] Add front-matter `triggers:` to `.claude/rules/` files specifying when each ruleset should activate
- [x] Split always-on rules (critical guardrails) from on-demand rules (coding style, patterns)
- [x] Minimize MEMORY.md to only irreversible-damage rules; move everything else to topic-specific files
- [x] Audit existing rules for relevance and remove outdated entries

### 7.2 Knowledge Sedimentation Rules — P2

Meta-rules about when and how to add knowledge to the project's documentation and memory files.

- [x] Create `docs/KNOWLEDGE_SEDIMENTATION.md` defining:
  - When an observation becomes a lesson (requires 2+ occurrences or irreversible impact)
  - What makes a good principle (falsifiable, contextual, actionable)
  - When to promote from session notes → LESSONS_LEARNED → CLAUDE.md rules
  - How to format knowledge for AI agent consumption (atomic, standalone, outcome-included)
- [x] Reference sedimentation rules from CLAUDE.md

### 7.3 Automated Experience Extraction — P3

Post-session hooks that extract lessons from development sessions into appropriate knowledge files.

- [x] Claude Code Stop hook: summarize key decisions and lessons from session *(PR #64 — experience-extraction-hook.ts)*
- [x] Route extracted knowledge to correct file (LESSONS_LEARNED.md, debugging.md, or relevant topic file) *(PR #64 — entity_type routing: decision, pattern, error, experience)*
- [x] Dedup against existing entries before writing *(PR #64 — Jaccard similarity threshold 0.85)*
- [x] Human review flag for non-obvious extractions *(PR #64 — `needs-review` tag for confidence < 0.7)*

### 7.4 Knowledge Maintenance / Dreaming — P3

Periodic review of accumulated knowledge for staleness, contradictions, and synthesis opportunities.

- [x] Monthly lint of LESSONS_LEARNED.md, MEMORY.md, `.claude/rules/` for outdated entries *(PR #65 — stale-entry lint pass)*
- [x] Cross-reference lessons against codebase changes (lessons about deleted code should be archived) *(PR #65 — git log --diff-filter=D cross-reference)*
- [x] Synthesis pass: identify clusters of related lessons and propose higher-level principles *(PR #65 — 2-hop BFS clustering + principle generation)*
- [x] Track "knowledge coverage" — which areas of the codebase have lessons vs. knowledge gaps *(PR #65 — coverage report as knowledge-health MemoryReport)*

## 8. Deployment & Operations

> Production deployment tooling, CLI/TUI monitoring, and operational guides.

<details>
<summary>✅ All complete — Deploy CLI, TUI monitor, deployment guide (PRs #72-#73)</summary>

### 8.1 Deploy CLI — P1

Interactive deployment management via `agentctl deploy` subcommands (`scripts/deploy.ts`).

- [x] `agentctl deploy init` — interactive .env generation, dependency checks (Node 22+, pnpm, Docker, PG, Redis), auto pnpm install + build + DB migration
- [x] `agentctl deploy up [--prod]` — dev mode (tsx watch) or prod mode (Docker Compose); `--worker` flag for worker-only machines
- [x] `agentctl deploy down` — stop all services (PM2 or Docker)
- [x] `agentctl deploy status` — parallel health checks on all services, table output
- [x] `agentctl deploy logs <service>` — stream logs from CP/Worker/Web

### 8.2 TUI Monitoring Panel — P1

Full-screen real-time monitoring via `agentctl tui` (Ink 4.x, `scripts/tui.tsx` + `scripts/tui/`).

- [x] Layout: 3-panel (Services status, Agents list, Activity feed)
- [x] ServicePanel: 5s polling of /health endpoints, red/green status indicators
- [x] AgentPanel: live agent list with status/cost/duration, keyboard selection
- [x] ActivityFeed: SSE real-time event stream from control plane
- [x] LogViewer: drill-down log viewer for selected service
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts: q(quit), r(restart), s(stop), l(logs), Enter(detail)

## 9. Agent Execution Quality (UX Gaps)

> Critical functional gaps in agent execution identified during real-world usage. These prevent agents from being usable in real workflows.

### 9.1 CLAUDE.md / Project Instructions Discovery — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #78. Added `--cwd <projectPath>` to `buildCliArgs()` in `cli-session-manager.ts`
> so the CLI explicitly discovers `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` from the correct project root.

- [x] Add `--cwd` flag to CLI args for explicit project root discovery *(PR #78)*
- [x] Test updated to verify `--cwd` is included in CLI args *(PR #78)*

### 9.2 MCP Server Configuration for Agents — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #80. Added `mcpServers` field to `AgentConfig` (shared types) and `.mcp.json` writing
> in `cli-session-manager.ts` before agent startup. MCP server config flows from agent config → CLI session → project dir.

- [x] Add `McpServerConfig` type and `mcpServers` field to `AgentConfig` *(PR #80)*
- [x] Write `.mcp.json` to project dir before CLI spawn *(PR #80)*
- [x] Store MCP server selection in agent config (`config.mcpServers`) *(PR #80)*
- [x] MCP server picker in agent creation/edit UI (web) *(PR #82)*
- [ ] Control plane → worker config downlink: include MCP config in job payload — future

> **User feedback**: Manual MCP form is bad UX. Needs auto-detection and managed push-down. See §11.6.

### 9.3 Agent Config as Default Prompt — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #79. Added `defaultPrompt` to `AgentConfig`, made `prompt` optional in start endpoint
> with fallback to `config.defaultPrompt`. Cron/heartbeat agents no longer need explicit prompt.

- [x] Add `defaultPrompt` field to `AgentConfig` type (shared) *(PR #79)*
- [x] Make `prompt` optional in `StartAgentBody` — fall back to `config.defaultPrompt` *(PR #79)*
- [x] UI: show default prompt in agent edit form; allow override on manual start *(PR #82)*

### 9.4 Cost Tracking Display Fix — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #79. Two bugs found and fixed:
> 1. `sdk-runner.ts` only emitted cost events when `message.usage` present, but `result` messages carry `total_cost_usd` without a `usage` object
> 2. Frontend field name mismatch: backend sent `{turnCost, totalCost}` but frontend expected `{totalCostUsd, inputTokens, outputTokens}`

- [x] Fix sdk-runner to emit cost events from `result` messages with `total_cost_usd` *(PR #79)*
- [x] Fix frontend SSE field name mismatch (`totalCost` → `totalCostUsd`) *(PR #79)*

### 9.5 Cron UX Improvements — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #81. Visual cron builder with presets, human-readable description, and next 5 runs preview.

- [x] Cron expression builder widget: visual picker with presets and human-readable preview *(PR #81)*
- [x] Show next 5 scheduled run times when editing cron expression *(PR #81)*
- [x] Alerting: health endpoint + badge for consecutive cron failures *(PR #84)*

### 9.6 Agent Execution History Improvements — P2 ✅

> Fixed in PR #81. Grouped by date with collapsible headers, filters by status/trigger/date, and summary stats.

- [x] Group runs by day with collapsible headers *(PR #81)*
- [x] Summary stats per time period: total runs, success rate, total cost, avg duration *(PR #81)*
- [x] Quick filters: status, trigger type, date range *(PR #81)*
- [x] Run timeline visualization (horizontal bar chart with recharts) *(PR #83)*

---

## 11. Agent Detail Page UX Fixes

> Five user-reported issues on the agent detail page (`/agents/[id]`).

### 11.1 Start Button Ignores defaultPrompt — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #86. `handleStart()` now computes `effectivePrompt = prompt.trim() || agent.config.defaultPrompt || ''` and only blocks when empty. Placeholder shows "Using default prompt..." when defaultPrompt exists.

- [x] Pre-fill prompt input with defaultPrompt *(PR #86)*
- [x] Allow "Go" without text if defaultPrompt exists *(PR #86)*

**Fix:**
- Pre-fill prompt input with `agent.config.defaultPrompt` when available
- Allow "Go" without entering text if defaultPrompt exists
- Show placeholder like "Using default prompt: {truncated}" when pre-filled

### 11.2 Agent Header Overflow — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #86. Added `truncate min-w-0 max-w-[300px]` + `title` tooltip to agent name `h1` element. Header flex container uses `min-w-0`.

- [x] CSS truncation with tooltip on hover *(PR #86)*

### 11.3 Cost Display Still $0.00 — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #87. Root cause: agent GET endpoint returned static 0 values. Fix: CP now computes `lastCostUsd` from most recent run and `totalCostUsd` as sum of all runs via DB registry methods.

- [x] `getLastRunCost(agentId)` — fetches most recent run's cost_usd *(PR #87)*
- [x] `getTotalCost(agentId)` — sums all runs' cost_usd *(PR #87)*
- [x] Agent GET route returns computed costs *(PR #87)*

### 11.4 Run History Bar Too Thin — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #88. Replaced thin `RunHistoryBar` with recharts `BarChart` component (`RunHistoryChart.tsx`). Shows duration as bar height, colored by status, with hover tooltips showing date/duration/status/cost.

- [x] `RunHistoryChart` component with recharts BarChart *(PR #88)*
- [x] Status-based coloring + tooltips *(PR #88)*

### 11.5 Execution History ↔ Session Linkage — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #88. `GroupedRunHistory` now shows "View Session" link for runs with sessionId. Run type includes `sessionId` field. API response maps session associations.

- [x] `sessionId` on run entries with clickable session link *(PR #88)*
- [x] API returns sessionId on runs *(PR #88)*

### 11.6 MCP Server Auto-Detection & Managed Config — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #89. Three-layer MCP discovery: project files (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`), machine-level, and managed templates. `McpServerPicker` replaces manual form with auto-detected + template cards.

- [x] Worker `GET /api/mcp/discover?projectPath=...` — scans project + global config *(PR #89)*
- [x] CP `GET /api/mcp/templates` — common MCP server templates *(PR #89)*
- [x] `McpServerPicker` component with source badges *(PR #89)*
- [x] `DiscoveredMcpServer` type with source tracking *(PR #89)*

### 11.7 Agent Settings Redesign — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #90. Full-page tabbed settings at `/agents/[id]/settings` with 5 tabs. `AgentFormDialog` simplified to quick-create mode (name, machine, type, model only).

- [x] `/agents/[id]/settings/page.tsx` — full-page settings with shadcn Tabs *(PR #90)*
- [x] `GeneralTab`, `ModelPromptsTab`, `PermissionsToolsTab`, `McpServersTab`, `MemoryTab` *(PR #90)*
- [x] Each tab saves independently via React Query mutations *(PR #90)*
- [x] "Settings" link on agent detail page *(PR #90)*
- [x] `AgentFormDialog` simplified for quick-create *(PR #90)*

## Target Workflow Summary

```
PR:              CI (lint + test) → Docker build → security scan (CodeQL + Semgrep + Trivy)
merge → dev:     CI → Docker build → push ghcr.io:dev-latest → deploy dev → health check → ZAP
merge → main:    CI → Docker build → push ghcr.io:main-latest → (ready for release)
GitHub Release:  push ghcr.io:v*.*.* → approval gate → DB backup + migrate → deploy prod → smoke
rollback:        workflow_dispatch → select tag → deploy → health check
fleet deploy:    canary → verify → matrix remaining → per-machine health check
nightly:         security audit agent → structured report → auto-create issues
session control: CLI -p (primary) → Agent SDK wrapper → tmux fallback
handoff:         manual / rate-limit / cost → serialize context → hydrate target → resume
task complete:   execution summary (session resume) → JSONB → summary card
steer:           chat input → control plane proxy → worker → SDK streamInput → ack
safety check:    workdir classify (4 tiers) → SSE event → approve/reject/sandbox → execute
runtime mgmt:    config sync → managed sessions → native import preflight → snapshot fallback
memory:          embed fact → pgvector HNSW → hybrid search (vector+BM25+graph RRF) → 3-tier injection
memory UI:       /memory (8 pages) → browser/graph/dashboard/consolidation/reports/import/editor/scopes
memory integ:    session/agent/machine/dashboard/context-picker/cmd-palette → contextual memory data
knowledge:       extract → lint (dedup+contradict) → synthesize (LLM propose) → human review → promote
feedback:        agent uses fact → memory_feedback(used/irrelevant/outdated) → adjust strength/ranking
```
