# Project Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-03-16 (recent follow-ups through PR #235 are now on `main`, including Discover session ID context in PR #229, deployment metrics in PR #230, execution-history polish in PR #231, the roadmap sync/consistency updates in PRs #232-#234, and deployment empty-history polish in PR #235; post-merge DAST rerun `23131047045` succeeded; there are currently no open PRs, CodeQL alerts, or Dependabot alerts)

## Current State

AgentCTL is a multi-machine AI agent orchestration platform with:

- **Web App**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React Query + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Control Plane**: Fastify + PostgreSQL + BullMQ + Drizzle ORM
- **Agent Worker**: Claude Agent SDK + node-pty + PM2
- **Mobile**: React Native (Expo) — early stage, but already ships unified session browsing/filtering, managed runtime session controls, handoff history, and agent detail streaming
- **CI/CD**: 9 GitHub Actions workflows (build, test, deploy, security, fleet)
- **Security**: OWASP Agentic Top 10 compliance, CodeQL + Semgrep + Trivy + ZAP

**7,255+ unit tests** across 111 files + **143 Playwright e2e tests**. All packages build and lint cleanly (TypeScript 0 errors, Biome 0 errors).

---

## 1. Infrastructure

> CI/CD pipeline, deployment, fleet management, database migrations.

<details>
<summary>✅ All complete — 9 workflows, full deploy chain, fleet rollout</summary>

### 1.1 CI Hardening

- [x] `dorny/paths-filter` for monorepo-aware conditional builds
- [x] pnpm store caching + TypeScript build cache
- [x] Security scanning: `pnpm audit`, `gitleaks`, Biome security lint

### 1.2 Docker Build & Registry

- [x] Multi-stage Docker build (`node:22-alpine`, non-root uid 1001)
- [x] Image tagging: `sha-<commit>`, `main-latest`/`dev-latest`, semver `v*.*.*`
- [x] Trivy + Grype container scanning, SBOM generation

### 1.3 Deployment Pipeline

- [x] Dev auto-deploy via Tailscale SSH on push to `dev`
- [x] Production deploy with GitHub Environment approval gate + blue-green
- [x] Rollback workflow (`workflow_dispatch` with tag selector)
- [x] Fleet deploy: canary → verify → matrix deploy remaining machines

### 1.4 Database Migration Safety

- [x] PR validation: throwaway PostgreSQL + `drizzle-kit generate`
- [x] Deploy-time: migration in transaction, `pg_dump` backup, destructive ops need approval

### 1.5 Observability & Notifications

- [x] Slack/Discord webhooks on deploy success/failure
- [x] Vector → ClickHouse structured logging pipeline
- [x] Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint

**Workflows**: `ci.yml`, `build-images.yml`, `deploy-dev.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`, `rollback.yml`, `deploy-fleet.yml`, `migration-check.yml`, `security-audit.yml`

</details>

## 2. Runtime Engine

> Agent lifecycle, scheduling, session control, execution safety.

<details>
<summary>✅ Scheduling, loop controller, session control — all delivered</summary>

### 2.1 Scheduled Sessions

- [x] `ScheduleConfig` type with `sessionMode: 'fresh' | 'resume'`
- [x] Prompt template variables: `{{date}}`, `{{iteration}}`, `{{lastResult}}`
- [x] DB: `schedule_config` JSONB column, cron API endpoints

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-02-scheduled-sessions-and-loop-design.md](plans/2026-03-02-scheduled-sessions-and-loop-design.md) (archived)

### 2.2 Continuous Loop (Ralph Loop)

- [x] `LoopController` with 3 modes: `result-feedback`, `fixed-prompt`, `callback`
- [x] Limits: `maxIterations`, `costLimitUsd`, `maxDurationMs`
- [x] Safety: dead-loop detection, cost alerts at 80%, auto-pause on checkpoint failure
- [x] SSE events: `loop_iteration`, `loop_checkpoint`, `loop_complete`

### 2.3 Session Control Architecture (3-Layer)

- [x] **Layer 1**: Claude Code CLI `-p` mode (primary — subprocess with structured I/O)
- [x] **Layer 2**: Agent SDK wrapper (hooks, tool gating, output streaming)
- [x] **Layer 3**: tmux fallback (attach to existing sessions)

</details>

### 2.4 Remote Control Integration (Relay Decision + Manual Takeover) — P2

> Claude Code Remote Control is an outbound relay to `claude.ai/code`.
> Current Anthropic docs no longer frame it as Max-only, but AgentCTL's managed
> runtime still fits `claude -p` better because `stream-json`, worker-side

> is already on `main` for Claude managed sessions via shared contracts,
> worker/control-plane lifecycle routes, `RcSessionManager`, and runtime-session
> web controls. The remaining roadmap item here is re-evaluating the relay only
> if Anthropic later exposes richer programmatic session APIs.

- [x] Spike: evaluate Remote Control relay vs current CLI `-p`
- [x] Decision: keep `claude -p` as the primary managed-session path for now
- [x] Narrow manual takeover flow for Claude managed sessions (`RcSessionManager`, worker/control-plane routes, runtime-session web controls)
- [ ] Re-evaluate only if Anthropic exposes programmatic relay events/session APIs

### 2.5 Structured Execution Summary — P1 ✅

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md](plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md) §11.1
>
> Status note: Fully delivered on `main` via PRs #32 (generation + types) and
> #39 (live SSE streaming + web/mobile rendering). The worker generates
> summaries on completion, streams them via `execution_summary` SSE events,
> and web/mobile render summary cards in session detail views.

Auto-generate structured summary at task completion via session resume.

- [x] Define `ExecutionSummary` type (status, workCompleted, executiveSummary, filesChanged, followUps, cost)
- [x] Implement summary generation in `AgentInstance.stop()`; post-hoc fallback already exists in the run summary route
- [x] DB migration: `agent_runs.result_summary` JSONB
- [x] SSE event: `execution_summary`
- [x] API: `GET /api/runs/:id/summary`
- [x] Summary card in web/mobile session view

### 2.6 Workdir Safety Tiers — P1 ✅

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md](plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md) §11.2

Pre-execution safety: safe (git clean) → guarded (dirty) → risky (non-git) → unsafe (parallel).

- [x] `checkWorkdirSafety()` in `agent-worker/src/runtime/workdir-safety.ts`
- [x] Gate in `AgentInstance.start()` before `attemptSdkRun()`
- [x] SSE events: `safety_warning`, `safety_approval_needed`, `safety_blocked`
- [x] Sandbox mode: copy-to-temp → execute → copy-back
- [x] API: `POST /api/agents/:id/safety-decision` (approve/reject/sandbox)

### 2.7 Dispatch Signature Verification — P1 ✅

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md](plans/2026-03-10-astro-agent-patterns-design.md) §11.3
>
> Status note: Implemented on `main` via signed control-plane dispatches, worker-side
> verification, and verification-key bootstrap on register/heartbeat. Remaining
> work here is roadmap hygiene rather than missing runtime wiring.

Ed25519 signing of dispatch payloads for defense-in-depth.

- [x] Control plane: sign payloads with TweetNaCl Ed25519
- [x] Workers: verify signature before execution, reject invalid
- [x] Public key distributed during machine registration
- [x] Audit: log verification failures

### 2.8 Mid-Execution Steering — P2 ✅

> Status note: Delivered on `main` via PR #45. `AgentInstance.steer()` using SDK
> `streamInput()`, worker + CP routes, `steer_injected` SSE event, and web
> `SteerInput` component in session detail view. Full test coverage across
> all packages.

Inject guidance into running sessions via SDK `streamInput()`.

- [x] `steer(message)` on `AgentInstance`
- [x] Worker API: `POST /api/agents/:agentId/steer`
- [x] Control plane proxy → forward to worker
- [x] SSE events: `steer_injected`
- [x] Chat-like input in live session view (`SteerInput` component)

### 2.9 Execution Environment Registry — P3

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-11-execution-environment-registry-design.md](plans/2026-03-11-execution-environment-registry-design.md)

> Status note: Delivered on `main`. Shared execution-environment contracts,
> `ExecutionEnvironment` / `DirectEnvironment` / `DockerEnvironment`, worker
> capability reporting, and control-plane environment selection are all landed.

Orthogonal WHERE (local/Docker/SSH) vs WHAT (Claude/Codex) abstraction.

- [x] `ExecutionEnvironment` interface: detect, prepare, cleanup
- [x] `DirectEnvironment` (subprocess)
- [x] `DockerEnvironment` (gVisor) *(PR #69 — gVisor runtime, cap-drop, read-only FS, network=none)*
- [x] Auto-detect at startup, report in heartbeat
- [x] Dispatch routing considers environment requirements

### 3.1 Codex CLI Core Integration

- [x] `ManagedRuntime = 'claude-code' | 'codex'` in shared contracts
- [x] `CodexRuntimeAdapter` + `CodexSessionManager` (create, resume, fork)
- [x] Runtime-aware routes: `GET|POST /api/runtime-sessions`, resume, fork, handoff
- [x] Machine registry: Codex sessions use same resolution path as Claude

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-09-codex-claude-runtime-unification-design.md](plans/2026-03-09-codex-claude-runtime-unification-design.md)

### 3.2 Session Handoff Protocol

> Status note: The native-import path remains experimental on `main`, but
> PR #126 already stabilized the worker integration test/log coverage around
> native-import preflight plus snapshot fallback. No broader native-import
> feature scope should be inferred from that merge.

- [x] `SessionHandoff` protocol: portable snapshot (worktree, branch, SHA, diff, conversation, MCP/skills)
- [x] `HandoffController`: export snapshot → hydrate target runtime → preserve worktree
- [x] Handoff reasons: `model-affinity`, `cost-optimization`, `rate-limit-failover`, `manual`
- [x] Experimental native import scaffolding with automatic snapshot fallback
- [x] Audit: every handoff + native import attempt logged

</details>

### 3.3 AgentOutputStream — Unified Output Streaming — P2 ✅

> Status note: Delivered on `main` via PR #29. Shared output contract,
> EventEmitter-backed stream, OutputBuffer, and runtime adapter integration
> are all landed.

Shared output contract between runtime adapters. Foundation for multi-runtime.

- [x] Define `AgentOutputStream` interface (text, thinking, toolUse, toolResult, fileChange, costUpdate, error)
- [x] Refactor `sdk-runner.ts` to emit through `AgentOutputStream`
- [x] `AgentInstance` stream impl backed by EventEmitter + OutputBuffer
- [x] Both `ClaudeRuntimeAdapter` and `CodexRuntimeAdapter` use same interface

### 3.4 Codex Operational Parity — P2

> Status note: Delivered on `main`. The worker renders managed Codex config,
> including sandbox, approval, provider, and shell-environment policy, detects
> Codex auth, runs under the shared PM2 worker process, and includes runtime
> sandbox/network enforcement evidence alongside LiteLLM routing/failover.

- [x] LiteLLM config: Codex model routing with OpenAI Direct → Azure OpenAI failover
- [x] PM2 ecosystem config for Codex-capable worker processes
- [x] Azure OpenAI credential detection for Codex authentication
- [x] Config renderer: `modelProvider`, `reasoningEffort`, and shell environment policy in Codex TOML
- [x] Sandbox constraints end-to-end: post-spawn verification (bubblewrap/Seatbelt/Codex), network enforcement, SSE `sandbox_verified` event *(PR #70)*

> Follow-through: the earlier Codex TOML MCP-discovery gap is addressed in §14,
> where runtime-aware discovery reads `.codex/config.toml` alongside Claude Code
> JSON configs.

### 3.5 Automatic Handoff Triggers — P2

> Design doc: [plans/2026-03-11-automatic-handoff-triggers-design.md](plans/2026-03-11-automatic-handoff-triggers-design.md)

> persistence, policy evaluation, run handoff history, dispatch-time
> task-affinity dry-run suggestions, and live rate-limit/cost-threshold
> execution are all landed.

- [x] Rate limit hit → failover to other agent type *(PR #66 — LiveHandoffOrchestrator + AgentInstance integration)*

## 7. Developer Knowledge Engineering

> Improvements to how agents learn and accumulate knowledge during AgentCTL development itself. Inspired by [stonepage's Agent 知识工程实践](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1898602837).

### 7.1 Layered Knowledge Loading — P2

Restructure `.claude/rules/` to avoid always-loading all rules. Most rules should be on-demand with trigger-based loading.

- [x] Add front-matter `triggers:` to `.claude/rules/` files specifying when each ruleset should activate
- [x] Split always-on rules (critical guardrails) from on-demand rules (coding style, patterns)
- [x] Minimize MEMORY.md to only irreversible-damage rules; move everything else to topic-specific files
- [x] Audit existing rules for relevance and remove outdated entries

### 7.2 Knowledge Sedimentation Rules — P2

Meta-rules about when and how to add knowledge to the project's documentation and memory files.

- [x] Create `docs/KNOWLEDGE_SEDIMENTATION.md` defining:
  - When an observation becomes a lesson (requires 2+ occurrences or irreversible impact)
  - What makes a good principle (falsifiable, contextual, actionable)
  - When to promote from session notes → LESSONS_LEARNED → CLAUDE.md rules
  - How to format knowledge for AI agent consumption (atomic, standalone, outcome-included)
- [x] Reference sedimentation rules from CLAUDE.md

### 7.3 Automated Experience Extraction — P3

Post-session hooks that extract lessons from development sessions into appropriate knowledge files.

- [x] Claude Code Stop hook: summarize key decisions and lessons from session *(PR #64 — experience-extraction-hook.ts)*
- [x] Route extracted knowledge to correct file (LESSONS_LEARNED.md, debugging.md, or relevant topic file) *(PR #64 — entity_type routing: decision, pattern, error, experience)*
- [x] Dedup against existing entries before writing *(PR #64 — Jaccard similarity threshold 0.85)*
- [x] Human review flag for non-obvious extractions *(PR #64 — `needs-review` tag for confidence < 0.7)*

### 7.4 Knowledge Maintenance / Dreaming — P3

Periodic review of accumulated knowledge for staleness, contradictions, and synthesis opportunities.

- [x] Monthly lint of LESSONS_LEARNED.md, MEMORY.md, `.claude/rules/` for outdated entries *(PR #65 — stale-entry lint pass)*
- [x] Cross-reference lessons against codebase changes (lessons about deleted code should be archived) *(PR #65 — git log --diff-filter=D cross-reference)*
- [x] Synthesis pass: identify clusters of related lessons and propose higher-level principles *(PR #65 — 2-hop BFS clustering + principle generation)*
- [x] Track "knowledge coverage" — which areas of the codebase have lessons vs. knowledge gaps *(PR #65 — coverage report as knowledge-health MemoryReport)*

---

## 8. Deployment & Operations

> Production deployment tooling, CLI/TUI monitoring, and operational guides.

<details>
<summary>✅ All complete — Deploy CLI, TUI monitor, deployment guide (PRs #72-#73)</summary>

### 8.1 Deploy CLI — P1

- [x] `agentctl deploy status` — parallel health checks on all services, table output
- [x] `agentctl deploy logs <service>` — stream logs from CP/Worker/Web

### 8.2 TUI Monitoring Panel — P1

Full-screen real-time monitoring via `agentctl tui` (Ink 4.x, `scripts/tui.tsx` + `scripts/tui/`).

- [x] Layout: 3-panel (Services status, Agents list, Activity feed)
- [x] ServicePanel: 5s polling of /health endpoints, red/green status indicators

## 9. Agent Execution Quality (UX Gaps)

> Critical functional gaps in agent execution identified during real-world usage. These prevent agents from being usable in real workflows.

### 9.1 CLAUDE.md / Project Instructions Discovery — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #78. Added `--cwd <projectPath>` to `buildCliArgs()` in `cli-session-manager.ts`
> so the CLI explicitly discovers `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` from the correct project root.

- [x] Add `--cwd` flag to CLI args for explicit project root discovery *(PR #78)*
- [x] Test updated to verify `--cwd` is included in CLI args *(PR #78)*

### 9.2 MCP Server Configuration for Agents — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #80. Added `mcpServers` field to `AgentConfig` (shared types) and `.mcp.json` writing
> in `cli-session-manager.ts` before agent startup. MCP server config flows from agent config → CLI session → project dir.

- [x] Add `McpServerConfig` type and `mcpServers` field to `AgentConfig` *(PR #80)*
- [x] Write `.mcp.json` to project dir before CLI spawn *(PR #80)*
- [x] Store MCP server selection in agent config (`config.mcpServers`) *(PR #80)*
- [x] MCP server picker in agent creation/edit UI (web) *(PR #82)*
- [x] Control plane → worker config downlink: include MCP config in job payload *(PR #132)*

> **User feedback**: Manual MCP form is bad UX. Needs auto-detection and managed push-down. See §11.6 (delivered) and §14 (next evolution: runtime-aware + skill discovery + machine defaults).

### 9.3 Agent Config as Default Prompt — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #79. Added `defaultPrompt` to `AgentConfig`, made `prompt` optional in start endpoint
> with fallback to `config.defaultPrompt`. Cron/heartbeat agents no longer need explicit prompt.

- [x] Add `defaultPrompt` field to `AgentConfig` type (shared) *(PR #79)*
- [x] Make `prompt` optional in `StartAgentBody` — fall back to `config.defaultPrompt` *(PR #79)*
- [x] UI: show default prompt in agent edit form; allow override on manual start *(PR #82)*

### 9.4 Cost Tracking Display Fix — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #79. Two bugs found and fixed:
> 1. `sdk-runner.ts` only emitted cost events when `message.usage` present, but `result` messages carry `total_cost_usd` without a `usage` object
> 2. Frontend field name mismatch: backend sent `{turnCost, totalCost}` but frontend expected `{totalCostUsd, inputTokens, outputTokens}`

- [x] Fix sdk-runner to emit cost events from `result` messages with `total_cost_usd` *(PR #79)*
- [x] Fix frontend SSE field name mismatch (`totalCost` → `totalCostUsd`) *(PR #79)*

### 9.5 Cron UX Improvements — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #81. Visual cron builder with presets, human-readable description, and next 5 runs preview.

- [x] Cron expression builder widget: visual picker with presets and human-readable preview *(PR #81)*
- [x] Show next 5 scheduled run times when editing cron expression *(PR #81)*
- [x] Alerting: health endpoint + badge for consecutive cron failures *(PR #84)*

### 9.6 Agent Execution History Improvements — P2 ✅

> Fixed in PR #81. Grouped by date with collapsible headers, filters by status/trigger/date, and summary stats.

- [x] Group runs by day with collapsible headers *(PR #81)*
- [x] Summary stats per time period: total runs, success rate, total cost, avg duration *(PR #81)*
- [x] Quick filters: status, trigger type, date range *(PR #81)*
- [x] Run timeline visualization (horizontal bar chart with recharts) *(PR #83)*

> Impl plan: [plans/2026-03-12-intelligence-layer-impl-plan.md](plans/2026-03-12-intelligence-layer-impl-plan.md)
>
> Four capabilities: smart routing (weighted scoring with historical performance), LLM-based task
> auto-decomposition, outcome learning (sliding-window feedback loop), and priority-based notification routing.

- [x] Smart Routing: capability match + load + cost + historical success scoring → ranked candidate selection (Phase 5a) — PR #113

---

## 11. Agent Detail Page UX Fixes

> Five user-reported issues on the agent detail page (`/agents/[id]`).

### 11.1 Start Button Ignores defaultPrompt — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #86. `handleStart()` now computes `effectivePrompt = prompt.trim() || agent.config.defaultPrompt || ''` and only blocks when empty. Placeholder shows "Using default prompt..." when defaultPrompt exists.

- [x] Pre-fill prompt input with defaultPrompt *(PR #86)*
- [x] Allow "Go" without text if defaultPrompt exists *(PR #86)*

**Fix:**
- Pre-fill prompt input with `agent.config.defaultPrompt` when available
- Allow "Go" without entering text if defaultPrompt exists
- Show placeholder like "Using default prompt: {truncated}" when pre-filled

### 11.2 Agent Header Overflow — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #86. Added `truncate min-w-0 max-w-[300px]` + `title` tooltip to agent name `h1` element. Header flex container uses `min-w-0`.

- [x] CSS truncation with tooltip on hover *(PR #86)*

### 11.3 Cost Display Still $0.00 — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #87. Root cause: agent GET endpoint returned static 0 values. Fix: CP now computes `lastCostUsd` from most recent run and `totalCostUsd` as sum of all runs via DB registry methods.

- [x] `getLastRunCost(agentId)` — fetches most recent run's cost_usd *(PR #87)*
- [x] `getTotalCost(agentId)` — sums all runs' cost_usd *(PR #87)*
- [x] Agent GET route returns computed costs *(PR #87)*

### 11.4 Run History Bar Too Thin — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #88. Replaced thin `RunHistoryBar` with recharts `BarChart` component (`RunHistoryChart.tsx`). Shows duration as bar height, colored by status, with hover tooltips showing date/duration/status/cost.

- [x] `RunHistoryChart` component with recharts BarChart *(PR #88)*
- [x] Status-based coloring + tooltips *(PR #88)*

### 11.5 Execution History ↔ Session Linkage — P1 ✅

> Fixed in PR #88. `GroupedRunHistory` now shows "View Session" link for runs with sessionId. Run type includes `sessionId` field. API response maps session associations.

- [x] `sessionId` on run entries with clickable session link *(PR #88)*
- [x] API returns sessionId on runs *(PR #88)*

### 11.6 MCP Server Auto-Detection & Managed Config — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #89. Three-layer MCP discovery: project files (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`), machine-level, and managed templates. `McpServerPicker` replaces manual form with auto-detected + template cards.
>
> **Next evolution**: §14 extends this with runtime-aware discovery (Codex TOML support), skill auto-discovery, machine-level defaults with per-agent opt-out overrides, and unified picker in both create and edit flows.

- [x] Worker `GET /api/mcp/discover?projectPath=...` — scans project + global config *(PR #89)*
- [x] CP `GET /api/mcp/templates` — common MCP server templates *(PR #89)*
- [x] `McpServerPicker` component with source badges *(PR #89)*
- [x] `DiscoveredMcpServer` type with source tracking *(PR #89)*

### 11.7 Agent Settings Redesign — P0 ✅

> Fixed in PR #90. Full-page tabbed settings at `/agents/[id]/settings` with 5 tabs. `AgentFormDialog` simplified to quick-create mode (name, machine, type, model only).

- [x] `/agents/[id]/settings/page.tsx` — full-page settings with shadcn Tabs *(PR #90)*
- [x] `GeneralTab`, `ModelPromptsTab`, `PermissionsToolsTab`, `McpServersTab`, `MemoryTab` *(PR #90)*
- [x] Each tab saves independently via React Query mutations *(PR #90)*
- [x] "Settings" link on agent detail page *(PR #90)*
- [x] `AgentFormDialog` simplified for quick-create *(PR #90)*

## 14. MCP & Skill Auto-Discovery

> Runtime-aware auto-discovery of MCP servers and skills from machine configs, with machine-level defaults and per-agent opt-out overrides.

> Design spec: [mcp-skill-discovery-design](superpowers/specs/2026-03-14-mcp-skill-discovery-design.md)
> Impl plan: [mcp-skill-discovery](superpowers/plans/2026-03-14-mcp-skill-discovery.md)

**Problem:** Creating or editing agents requires manually entering MCP server and skill configs every time. In a multi-agent, multi-machine environment this is O(n) repetitive work. Each machine already has MCP servers configured in Claude Code's `~/.claude.json` and Codex's `.codex/config.toml`, plus skills in `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`, but the platform doesn't auto-discover them.

### 14.1 Shared Types & Override Resolution — P0 ✅

## 16. Bug Fixes & Quality

### 16.1 Agent Run Quality — P0

- Stability/security cycle plan: [plans/2026-03-15-main-stability-and-security-cycle-plan.md](plans/2026-03-15-main-stability-and-security-cycle-plan.md) *(delivered on `main`; synced after PR #227 and successful DAST rerun `23131047045`)*
- Status note: `main` is re-stabilized for the CI/CodeQL/Dependabot/DAST backlog through PR #227. After PRs #206-#210, the follow-up instructions-strategy/config-preview path hardening landed via PRs #217 and #219, the agent-settings coverage follow-up landed via PR #220, PR #222 bundled control-plane drizzle migrations during build, PR #223 aligned the DAST/bootstrap PostgreSQL images with `pgvector`, PR #226 moved the generated OpenAPI target into the ZAP-mounted workspace, and PR #227 moved local DAST bootstrap onto the same runners that execute the scans. The post-merge DAST rerun `23131047045` succeeded. The lingering Fastify rate-limit plus stale Alpine-image findings remain dispositioned as tooling/modeling false positives relative to the current source. There are currently no open PRs, CodeQL alerts, or Dependabot alerts on `main`.

- [x] Local DAST scan jobs now self-bootstrap the control-plane on the same runners that execute the scans; post-merge rerun `23131047045` succeeded *(PR #227)*
- [x] Stale old-Alpine Grype findings dismissed after PR #205 moved current runtime images to `bookworm-slim` *(direct dismissal, 2026-03-15)*

- [x] Version display updated to v0.2.0 *(direct commit ff9ab3e)*

### 16.3 Frontend UI Polish — P0

Systematic design critique (2026-03-15) identified these issues. Root cause: features stacked without holistic design review, violating CLAUDE.md design principles (Cyber · Geeky · Futuristic).

> Follow-up PRs #212-#213 (2026-03-16) closed the remaining Discover summary-selection bug for Codex sessions and replaced misleading zero-duration session copy with clearer "Running now"/"instant" states.

**P1 — Dashboard visual hierarchy:**
- [x] Reduce 8 metric cards to 3 prominent + inline secondary stats *(PR #158)*
- [x] Remove "Native Import" and "Total Cost" as standalone cards *(PR #158)*
- [x] Fix "New Session" button text visibility *(PR #158)*
- [x] Fix "Memory Health: Could not load memory stats" — either fix or hide
- [x] Sanitize session summaries *(PR #158)* (raw XML tags like `<local-command-caveat>` showing)
- [x] Filter out "Untitled session *(PR #158)* / 0 msgs" from discovered sessions list

**P2 — Agent Detail page restructure:**
- [x] Separate metadata *(PR #159)* (name/status/model) from actions (start/settings/refresh) into distinct rows
- [x] Move prompt input from inline *(PR #159)* to a Start dialog (triggered by Start button)
- [x] Remove or label icon buttons *(PR #159)* (download/copy) below agent name — add tooltips or remove
- [x] Go button color: *(PR #159)* use `primary` token consistently, not raw blue

**P3 — Run History redesign:**
- [x] Merge Run History strip *(PR #159)* + Run Timeline chart into single timeline view (same data shown twice)
- [x] Replace raw red/green *(PR #159)* with muted semantic colors (`emerald-500/20`, `red-500/20`, `neutral-500/20` for empty)
- [x] Add hover tooltips *(PR #159)* (time, cost, duration, trigger, session link)
- [x] Style as terminal-native timeline *(PR #159)*, not generic recharts BarChart

**P4 — Agent Cards (list page):**
- [x] Remove prompt input + Go from card *(PR #160)* body — cards show info only
- [x] Card actions: "Start" button *(PR #160)* (opens dialog) + "Settings" link only
- [x] Truncate project path *(PR #160)* with tooltip instead of wrapping
- [x] Display: name, status badge *(PR #160)*, machine, project (truncated), last run, cost

**P5 — Button consistency:**
- [x] Establish button hierarchy *(PRs #158-#160)*: primary (filled), secondary (outline), ghost (text only)
- [x] Each page has exactly one primary action button *(PRs #158-160, #246)*
- [x] Normalize all pages to use shadcn Button variants *(PRs #158-160, #246)*

**Sessions page:**
- [x] Session IDs as titles *(PR #161)* (f1220b44-584f...) — should show agent name or summary instead
- [x] "Duration: 0s" copy clarified *(PR #213)* — active zero-duration sessions render as "Running now" and completed zero-duration sessions render as "instant"
- [x] Multiple empty sessions *(PR #161)* (Duration: 0s) from failed starts clutter the list — filter or mark as "empty"
- [x] Right panel "Select a session *(PR #242)* to view details" is wasted space — could show summary stats

**Machines page:**
- [x] Machine metrics: Online prominent, rest inline *(PR #246)*
- [x] "GPU" / "Docker" capability badges use proper badges with icons *(PR #165)*
- [x] Machine card green left border *(PR #242)* is inconsistent with other cards

**Settings page (Runtime Control Center):**
- [x] Best designed page — good sidebar nav, clear hierarchy, informative right panel ✅
- [x] "WHY THIS CHANGED" callout box is a nice touch ✅
- [x] Dependency latency cards with color coding (green/yellow/red) *(PR #246)*

**Memory page:**
- [x] "0 facts" empty state guides users to import data *(PR #165)*
- [x] Entity type checkboxes *(PR #242)* not styled as badges/chips — looks like a raw HTML form
- [x] Min Confidence slider *(PR #242)* has no visual feedback

**Spaces page:**
- [x] Empty state is clean and actionable ✅ ("Create your first space" button)
- [x] Header "Spaces" deduplicated *(PR #165)*

**Discover page:**
- [x] Codex session discovery now prefers the first meaningful user task over AGENTS/system-prompt preamble *(PR #212)*
- [x] Session IDs now show 12 characters for better context *(PR #229)*
- [x] "3 already imported" link is nice ✅

**Deployment page:**
- [x] Best specialized page — tier cards with green border + RUNNING badge work well ✅
- [x] Dev tier cards now show real MEM/UPTIME values from health payloads, with PM2 metrics taking precedence when present *(PR #230)*
- [x] Empty promotion history now renders a subtle designed placeholder instead of a lonely text-only line *(PR #235)*

**General:**
- [x] Version in sidebar: auto-update from package.json (version-bump.sh updates `Sidebar.tsx`) *(PR #166)*
- [x] "New Session" button text visibility fixed *(PR #158)*
- [x] Dashboard stale "View Agents" and "Runtime Sessions" buttons removed *(direct commit ff9ab3e)*
- [x] Discover summary extraction no longer prefers system prompt text for Codex sessions *(PR #212)*
- [x] Execution history now shows retry badges, clearer empty-status labels, and collapsible retry groups *(PR #231)*

### 16.4 Agent Settings Config Preview Sidebar — P1

> Design spec: [config-preview-sidebar-design](superpowers/specs/2026-03-15-config-preview-sidebar-design.md)
> Impl plan: [config-preview-sidebar](superpowers/plans/2026-03-15-config-preview-sidebar.md)

## 17. Ongoing Quality & Testing

### 17.1 Resolved CodeQL Alert Cleanup — P0 ✅

- [x] `js/http-to-file-access` *(PR #209)* in `path-security.ts:133` — HTTP-sourced data written to files
- [x] `js/insecure-temporary-file` *(PR #209)* in `path-security.ts:133` — insecure temp file creation
- [x] `js/path-injection` *(PR #219)* in `config-preview.ts:212` — preview route project-instruction reads now use shared path-security wrappers

### 17.2 E2E Test Coverage — P1

- [x] Enable 17 skipped *(PR #210)* E2E tests across mcp-skill-discovery, runtime-selector, critical-flows, smoke specs
- [x] Write real Playwright *(PR #210)* implementations for stub tests (currently just comments)

### 17.3 CLAUDE.md Management Strategy — P0

> Delivered in PRs #215 and #218, with targeted web coverage in PR #220.

Agent settings should allow users to control how CLAUDE.md is handled at session start:

- [x] Add "Instructions Strategy" selector to Model & Prompts tab with 3 options *(PR #215)*:
  - **"Use project's CLAUDE.md"** (default) — AgentCTL does NOT write CLAUDE.md, Claude CLI reads the project's existing file
  - **"Managed by AgentCTL"** — AgentCTL writes a managed CLAUDE.md (current behavior, but only when user explicitly opts in)
  - **"Merge"** — AgentCTL reads the project's CLAUDE.md, appends the agent's System Prompt + custom instructions, writes the merged result
- [x] Store strategy in `AgentConfig.instructionsStrategy: 'project' | 'managed' | 'merge'` *(PR #215)* with `'project'` as the default
- [x] Config renderer: implement all 3 strategies in `ClaudeConfigRenderer` and `CodexConfigRenderer` *(PR #215)*
- [x] Config preview: show the effective CLAUDE.md based on selected strategy (project content, managed template, or merged) *(PR #215)*
- [x] Project strategy preview reads the actual project `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` content instead of a managed placeholder *(PR #218)*
- [x] Default new agents to `'project'` — never override CLAUDE.md unless user chooses to *(PR #215)*
- [x] Web regression coverage for instructions-strategy saves + fallback behavior *(PR #220)*

### 17.4 Agent Permission Approval System — P0

Critical gap: when agent permission mode is NOT bypass, CLI outputs `permission_request` events but AgentCTL has no way for users to approve/deny. Agent hangs until timeout → killed.

**Architecture**: Use existing notification center (NotificationBell) + WebSocket infrastructure.

- [x] Worker captures `permission_request` *(PRs #238-240)* events from CLI stdout stream
- [x] Worker forwards permission requests *(PRs #238-240)* via SSE to control plane
- [x] CP stores pending approvals *(PRs #238-240)* in DB + pushes to frontend via WebSocket
- [x] Notification center shows pending *(PRs #238-240)* approval with: agent name, tool name, command preview, approve/deny buttons
- [x] User clicks Approve/Deny *(PRs #238-240)* → frontend sends decision via WebSocket → CP → Worker
- [x] Worker writes approval via canUseTool hook *(PRs #238-240)* to CLI stdin (stream-json input)
- [x] Timeout handling: auto-deny *(PRs #238-240)* after configurable timeout (default 5 min)
- [ ] Mobile (iOS): push notification for pending approvals
- [x] Fix: `bypassPermissions` now correctly uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` *(direct commit 7c66ec2)*

> Design spec: [permission-approval-system-design v2](superpowers/specs/2026-03-16-permission-approval-system-design.md)
> Impl plan: [permission-approval-system](superpowers/plans/2026-03-18-permission-approval-system.md)
> Status: ✅ Core approval workflow delivered in PRs #238-240. Remaining follow-up: iOS push notifications.

### 17.5 Agent Run State Machine Visibility — P1

Agent run lifecycle has hidden intermediate states users can't see:

- [x] Show dispatch states in UI *(PR #241)*: queued → dispatching → worker_contacted → cli_spawning → mcp_loading → running → completed
- [x] Retry runs visually grouped under original run (collapsible) *(PR #231)*
- [x] Empty runs shown with gray badge + clearer empty-status labeling *(PR #231)*
- [x] Run timeline shows state transitions *(PR #241)* with timestamps
